        <p>I like the use of Amazon Web Services (AWS) to interact with my project. AWS made it very easy to host my code and create a REST API without worrying about having a server.<br><br>I also like the idea of subscribing to beers and to be notified when their price changes. If I am to continue this project and turn it into an app, that feature would be useful to send users push notifications rather than emails.<br><br>Finally, I like the upvoting and downvoting aspect of the site. It allows users to give their input as to whether a price report is accurate. In future versions, users will be able to receive badges based on the accuracy of their posts (upvotes minus downvotes for their price reports) incentivizing users to post correct price reports.</p>
